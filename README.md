# Walkie-Chat – Proximity Text Chat Mod

**Walkie-Chat** is a simple mod that adds a **proximity-based chat system** to Minecraft.  
With this mod, players can only send and receive messages in the game chat when they are near each other — bringing a new level of **immersion** to survival, multiplayer, and RPG servers.

To help with long-distance communication, the mod also adds a special **"Walkie Talkie"** item that allows players to chat from anywhere, as long as both are tuned to the same frequency.

• Recommended for adventure or survival ModPacks.
